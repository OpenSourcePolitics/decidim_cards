name: Followings
description: >
  All actions of followings made on the platform. Mind that Decidim counts 
  followings in two different way: following made on a specific resource
  (proposal, comment, etc.), called "direct follow" and following made on a 
  component, in this case all resources inside it are counted as followed. 
  Therefore, a "followable resource" means the resource that the user choose to 
  follow directly, whereas a "root followable" is a component to which belong the 
  followed resource.

        Way this following was counted: if equal to 'real_follow', it means the 
        user followed this resource in particular. When equal to 'ancestor_follow', 
        it means that the user choosed to follow the component of participatory 
        space to which belong this resource, therefore Decidim consider this user 
        also follows the resources inside that component or participatory space
